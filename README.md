# Issues
Submit issues to this repo regarding any lab assignments or homework.

This repo is public, which means all of you can see it and any issue you raise here will be visible to everyone in the class.

To submit an issue (which is a catch all term we are using for questions), click on the "Issues" tab (visible in the upper left hand corner next to "Code") and describe, to the best of your ability.

Afterwards, one of the instructors, TAs, or Stundents who have faced the same isssue, can elect to answer your question. Since this is visible to everyone, everyone should benefit.

In a development environment, issues usually follow one of two (or both) formats:
  - Bug reports: a user who used the project would submit an issue to address a bug they encoutnered. This prompts the authors to investigate and improve their code.
  - Feature Requests: a user who used the project would submit an issue to ask the authors to add a feature to the code to increase usability. Depending on the engagement on that particular issue, the authors can choose to add the feature or suggest a workaround
  
 For our purposes, we will just use this to submit questions and collectively benefit from eachother's experience.
